    <h1>Animal Style Fries</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone knows that despite being freshly cut, the pale and soggy fries are In-N-Out's weakest point, but if you
        smother
        them in cheese, sweet caramelized onions, and In-N-Out spread, they're magical. So replacing the sad fries with
        crispy frozen fries
        really is an improvement over the originals here. Spread is just a basic sweet and tangy burger sauce with mayo,
        ketchup,
        relish, a little sugar, and a little vinegar. The onions are really the stars here - soft, sweet, and jammy. Be
        sure to serve
        immediately as soon as the fries are cooked - the residual heat of the fries and the onions is what melts the
        cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons water,divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fries</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1(28 ounce) package frozen shoestring potato fries</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b>Prepare the Spread: Whisk together mayonnaise, ketchup, relish, sugar, and
            vinegar in a small bowl until well combined. Cover and set aside until serving.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b>Prepare the Grilled Onions: Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium.
            Add onions and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden
            brown, about 20 minutes. When skillet starts to become dry, add 1 tablespoon
            of water. Continue cooking, stirring often, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at
            a time, as needed, until onions are very soft, deeply browned, and jammy, 10
            to 15 more minutes (you may not need to use all the water). Cover and set
            aside to keep warm. </li>
        <li><b>Step 3:</b>Prepare fries according to package instructions.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4:</b>Divide fries evenly among 4 plates; immediately top with 1 slice cheese, 3
            tablespoons grilled onions, and 3 tablespoons spread. </li>
    </ol>
